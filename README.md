# Introduction:

Hello my name is Svetlana. I am a college graduate at Drake University. I graduated with a Computer Science Major and Data Analytics and AI Minor.

I am a computer science graduate looking for a full time job opportunity in software\development, data engineering, entry level IT or  
another related area that allows me to apply the skills and education acquired through my college courses, experience and background.

# My Projects:
CS066 Final Project:
The final project for my data structures class. This final project currently doesn't work because the API website no longer exists.
This project demonstrates my ability to successully use APIs. I have added a video of my project working.

Roman Numerals:
A small project that helps demonstrate my Python skills. 
Takes in an input value and converts the value to either a Roman numeral or an integer. I have added additional unit tests in another folder called Tests.

Peg Elimination Game:
A current personal project to simulate the Peg Solitare game. It is also known as the Crackerbarrel Peg Game. 
All of the rules are implemented and the game works, however, the UI is not friendly, and my next step for this project.
