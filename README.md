# Introduction:

Hello my name is Svetlana. I am currently a college student at Drake University. I am currently a Computer Science Major and a Data Analytics Minor.

I am looking for an internship opportunity in software development, data engineering, or other related areas that allows me to apply the skills
and education acquired through my college courses, experience, and background.

# My Projects:
CS066 Final Project:
The final project for my data structures class. This final project currently doesn't work because the API website no longer exists.

Roman Numerals:
A small project that helps demonstrate my Python skills. 
Takes in an input value and converts the value to either a Roman numeral or an integer. I have added additional unit tests in another folder called Tests.

Peg Elimination Game:
A current personal project to simulate the Peg Solitare game. It is also known as the Crackerbarrel Peg Game. 
All of the rules are implemented and the game works, however, the UI is not friendly, and my next step for this project.
