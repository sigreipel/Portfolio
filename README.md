# Introduction:

Hello my name is Svetlana. I am currently a college student at Drake University. I am currently a Computer Science Major and Data Analytics Minor.

I am looking for an internship opportunity in software development, data engineering or other related area that allows me to apply the skills
and education acquired through my college courses, experience and background.

# My Projects:
Project 1 is a final project for my data structures class. This final project currently doesn't work because the API website does not exist anymore.
